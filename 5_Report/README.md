# M3_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
Windshield wipers keep the windshield of a vehicle clear from rain water, snow, dust and road spray. The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. Virtually all wipers today employ an electric motor coupled with a linkage mechanism and are actuated by a knob beside the steering wheel. The wiper blade speed can be adjusted by the driver.
