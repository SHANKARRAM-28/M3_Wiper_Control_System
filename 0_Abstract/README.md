# CAR_WIPER_CONTROL_SYSTEM
Wiper is a necessary component that wont to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous systemused to activate the wiper manually and also the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this technique isproposed to resolve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to boost the system by using sensor with actuator and to style a basic program which will fully operate withthe system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is comparable with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing water from windscreen, this method also are upgraded to an automatic system by employing a Peripheral Interface Controller and sensor. 
The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the skin of a car. 
This project showed a contribution on the look of the automated wiper system for the longer term research during this same field. It is recommended that the system to possess a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.
